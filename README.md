this project is done for minor project 1.It contains my own try for making calculator by python .I think 
it would be correct but i don't know how ,it is basicaly about;
 * The program starts by importing the NumPy library for array operations.
* A menu is displayed to the user showing all available calculator operations.
 * The user selects an operation by entering a choice number.
 * Based on the user’s choice, the program asks for the required input values.
* For addition, numbers are stored in a NumPy array and summed using np.sum().
* Other operations (subtraction, multiplication, power, modulus) are performed using basic Python operators.
* For division, the program checks if the denominator is zero to avoid errors.
* The calculated result is displayed to the user.
* The menu repeats until the user selects the Exit option.
